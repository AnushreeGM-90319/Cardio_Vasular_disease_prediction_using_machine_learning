# Cardio_Vasular_disease_prediction_using_machine_learning

• Source: Provided CSV file.
• Features:
o Demographic: Age, Gender
o Physical: Height, Weight
o Vital Signs: Systolic and Diastolic blood pressure (ap_hi, ap_lo)
o Lifestyle: Smoking, Alcohol intake, Physical activity
o Biochemical: Cholesterol, Glucose levels
• Target: cardio (0: No disease, 1: Disease)


Machine Learning Models Used:
▪ Logistic Regression (LR).
▪ Support Vector Machine (SVM).
▪ K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
▪ Decision Trees (DT).
▪ Random Forest (RF).
o Evaluation Metrics:
▪ Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Confusion Matrix.
o Results:
▪ Logistic Regression: 72% accuracy.
▪ Random Forest: 75% accuracy (Best performing model).
▪ KNN: 68% accuracy.
▪ SVM and Decision Trees also performed moderately well.



Key Findings:
o High cholesterol and glucose levels significantly increase cardiovascular risk.
o Regular physical activity reduces the risk of heart disease.
o Age and gender are notable predictors.
